### cwru_376_student
Repository for student groups to fork and edit for EECS 376/476 Spring 2014 

Student groups, please fork this repository to the account of whoever is in charge of maintaining your codebase.  Please be aware that changes may be made to the repository from time to time so you may need to sync it to keep your code up-to-date.

After forking, please rename the repo, replacing "student" with some kind of identifier for your group.

Code will be run on the robots during development by setting up your computer to publish and subscribe to a ROS master located over network on one of the physical robots.  After you get the smaller kinks worked out, you will "deploy" your code by cloning your groups repository locally on the robot and running your code directly from there.
